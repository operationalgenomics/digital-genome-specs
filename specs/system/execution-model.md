# System Execution Model
### Orchestration, Actuation, Monitoring, and Feedback Pathways for Cognitive-to-Operational Execution

---

## 1. Purpose

The **System Execution Model** defines how decisions generated by the Cognitive Core are transformed into actionable, safe, and verifiable operations in both **physical** and **digital** environments.

Execution is the materialization of cognition.  
It connects:
- **Intent** (UNL)
- **Reasoning** (Cognitive Core)
- **Knowledge** (Digital Genome)
- **Governance** (policy, safety, authority)
- **Action** (orchestration + actuation)
- **Learning** (monitoring + feedback)

The model ensures that every operation:
- is executed safely,
- follows praxeological codon structure,
- is traceable back to cognitive reasoning,
- contributes data for monitoring and evolution.

## 2. Design Principles

### 2.1 Deterministic Execution
Given the same execution plan and context, the system must behave identically.

### 2.2 Codon-Centric Orchestration
Execution is composed of **codons**, each representing a discrete transformation:
```ts
[ Entity | Action | Target-State ]
```

### 2.3 Safety and Governance Supremacy
Execution must not proceed if:
- a safety envelope is violated,
- governance requires human approval,
- forbidden states are detected.

### 2.4 Transparent Operational Traceability
Every executed step must be:
- logged,
- timestamped,
- linked to its codon,
- linked to the originating gene.

### 2.5 Closed-Loop Behavior
Execution produces monitoring → feedback → evolution → genome refinement.

## 3. Architectural Layers

Execution is composed of **five layers**.

### 3.1 Execution Gateway
Responsible for:
- validating governance mode,
- verifying operator authorization,
- enforcing safety envelopes,
- blocking forbidden transitions.

### 3.2 Orchestration Engine
Transforms codon sequences into operational workflows:
- resolves dependencies,
- applies ordering and parallelization rules,
- handles retries and compensations,
- binds actions to actuators.

### 3.3 Actuation Layer
Executes actions on:
- industrial machinery,
- PLCs and controllers,
- robotic manipulators,
- software systems (APIs, microservices),
- digital twin environments.

### 3.4 Monitoring Layer
Observes outcomes and collects telemetry:
- state transitions,
- errors and anomalies,
- performance metrics,
- safety violations.

### 3.5 Feedback Engine
Interprets results and generates:
- fitness updates,
- simulation adjustments,
- evolutionary triggers,
- governance audit logs.

## 4. Data Structures

### 4.1 Execution Plan
```ts
interface ExecutionPlan {
  id: string;
  geneId: GeneId;
  codonSequence: PraxeologicalCodon[];
  steps: ExecutionStep[];
  safetyEnvelope: SafetyEnvelope;
  expectedOutcomes?: ExpectedOutcome[];
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
}
```

### 4.2 Execution Step
```ts
interface ExecutionStep {
  stepId: string;
  codon: PraxeologicalCodon;
  actionBinding: ActionBinding;
  preConditions: ConditionExpression[];
  postConditions: ConditionExpression[];
  fallbackSteps?: string[];
}
```

### 4.3 Safety Envelope
```ts
interface SafetyEnvelope {
  maxPressure?: number;
  maxTemperature?: number;
  restrictedZones?: string[];
  prohibitedStates?: StateId[];
}
```

### 4.4 Monitoring Event
```ts
interface MonitoringEvent {
  timestamp: Timestamp;
  entity: EntityId;
  state: string;
  metrics: Record<string, unknown>;
  safetyFlags?: string[];
}
```

### 4.5 Execution Outcome
```ts
interface ExecutionOutcome {
  planId: string;
  codonResults: CodonOutcome[];
  success: boolean;
  anomalies?: string[];
  safetyIncidents?: string[];
  metrics?: Record<string, unknown>;
}
```

## 5. Execution Workflow

### 5.1 Step 1 — Decision Reception
The Cognitive Core outputs:
- selected gene,
- codon sequence,
- contextual intent,
- safety envelope.

### 5.2 Step 2 — Execution Plan Assembly
The Orchestration Engine:
- expands codons into steps,
- resolves dependencies,
- generates bindings.

### 5.3 Step 3 — Safety Envelope Enforcement
Execution Gateway verifies:
- state constraints,
- governance mode,
- environment safety.

### 5.4 Step 4 — Actuation
The Actuation Layer sends real commands to:
- industrial equipment,
- robotic systems,
- software services.

### 5.5 Step 5 — Monitoring
Observes:
- state changes,
- failures or anomalies,
- safety violations.

### 5.6 Step 6 — Outcome Classification
Outcome is labeled as:
- success,
- partial success,
- safe failure,
- unsafe failure.

### 5.7 Step 7 — Feedback Injection
Result affects:
- simulation accuracy,
- gene fitness,
- evolutionary triggers,
- governance reports.

## 6. Orchestration Rules

### 6.1 Ordering and Dependencies
Execution order must follow codon sequencing unless explicitly parallelizable.

### 6.2 Parallelization Rules
Parallel execution allowed when:
- entities do not conflict,
- safety rules permit.

### 6.3 Retry Logic
Retries allowed if:
- bounded,
- safe,
- governance permits.

### 6.4 Compensation Logic
If a step fails:
- restore stable state,
- perform fallback codons.

---

## 7. Safety and Governance Integration

### 7.1 Forbidden Actions
Execution blocked when:
- state transitions violate rules,
- entity enters prohibited states.

### 7.2 Human-In-The-Loop
If governance mode = `review`:
- require operator confirmation.

### 7.3 Emergency Procedures
If critical anomaly detected:
- auto-trigger safety codons,
- isolate affected components,
- notify governance.

### 7.4 Full Traceability
All actions logged with:
- IDs,
- timestamps,
- codon references,
- entity states.

---

## 8. Monitoring and Feedback Interaction
Execution continuously feeds:
- performance metrics,
- anomaly classifications,
- environmental context updates,
- safety flags.

These updates refine:
- simulation accuracy,
- gene fitness,
- evolution triggers.

## 10. Summary

The **System Execution Model** transforms cognitive decisions into operational action while enforcing:
- safety,
- governance,
- traceability,
- determinism,
- and continuous learning.

Execution is where the Digital Genome Ecosystem **interacts with reality**, verifies assumptions, collects evidence, and adapts for the next iteration.
