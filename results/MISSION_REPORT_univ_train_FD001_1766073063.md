## 🧬 Craft Performance Matrix (Chapter 6 Analysis)
*Equation: CP = M_P (Intent) × M_C (Physics) × M_N (Strategy) × M_M (Evolution)*

### 🔹 Top Adaptations (The "Apollo 13" Moments)
*Cases where the Meristic Motor (M_M) intervened to raise the CP above survival threshold.*

| Gene ID | M_P (Executive) | M_C (Judiciary) | M_N (Legislative) | M_M (Meristic) | **Final CP** |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **3fc1e94e** | 1.00 | 0.85 | 0.90 | 0.95 | **0.8000** |
| **006a9f90** | 1.00 | 0.85 | 0.90 | 0.95 | **0.8000** |
| **63a9905b** | 1.00 | 0.85 | 0.90 | 0.95 | **0.8000** |
| **46523854** | 1.00 | 0.85 | 0.90 | 0.95 | **0.8000** |
| **d0b63384** | 1.00 | 0.85 | 0.90 | 0.95 | **0.8000** |


### 💀 Critical Vetoes (The "Non-Compensatory" Principle)
*Cases where one motor voted 0.0, collapsing the entire CP to zero (Section 6.2.1).*

## 📝 Convergence Analysis
> "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts." — Aristotle

1. **Compression Principle:** The final *Craft Performance* never exceeds the score of the weakest motor.
2. **Praxeological Short-Circuit:** 0.0% of cases were resolved by memory ($M_P=1.0$), bypassing complex calculation of other motors during normal operation phase.
