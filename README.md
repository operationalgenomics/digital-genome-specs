# Operational Genomics — Technical Specifications

This repository contains the formal technical specification of *Operational Genomics* — 
a discipline created by Carlos Eduardo Favini that unifies **data, AI, intention and 
action** into coherent, evolutive, and explainable operational knowledge systems.

Its purpose is to define the **structure, semantics, constraints, and evolution 
mechanisms** behind the Digital Genome architecture.

## 📐 Core Specification Areas

The repository is organized into six major domains:

### 1. **Codons**
Atomic units of purposeful action.  
They encode *intent → preconditions → instructions → exception handling*.

### 2. **Operational Genes**
Composable sequences of codons that express coherent functional capabilities.

### 3. **Digital Genome**
The full knowledge organism containing genes, metadata, inheritance structures,  
versioning, merism, and contextual fit.

### 4. **Cognitive Core**
The neuro-symbolic decision engine responsible for interpretation, simulation,  
reasoning, and operational coherence.

### 5. **UNL — Universal Neutral Language**
The intention-based semantic layer enabling meaning transfer between humans,  
machines, and operational entities.

### 6. **Diagrams**
Canonical diagrams that visually define the architecture.
