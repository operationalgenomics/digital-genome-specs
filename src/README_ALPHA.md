# DIGITAL GENOME: THE VOYAGER ARCHITECTURE (MVP 2)
### Operational Genomics & Autonomous Resilience

## 🌌 The Concept

The **Digital Genome** is a bio-inspired cognitive architecture designed for Industry 5.0 and Deep Space Exploration. It implements **Operational Genomics**: the idea that operational knowledge should be encoded as living DNA (Operational Genes) rather than static rules.

This version (MVP 2 "Voyager") introduces **Meristic Evolution**: the capability to autonomously invent solutions to critical failures in real-time, simulating the "Apollo 13" engineering process.

## 🧠 Core Engines

1.  **UNL-0 (Universal Neutral Language):**
    * *Function:* Pre-sensory Perception.
    * *Mechanism:* Analyzes Signal Topology (Entropy, FFT, Volatility) to distinguish between Machine, Human, and Nature without semantic training.
    * *File:* `src/unl_core.py`

2.  **Cognitive Core (The Brain):**
    * *Function:* Vectorized Decision Making.
    * *Mechanism:* Calculates Euclidean distance between the Current State and the Archetype of Chaos. Uses State Vectors instead of linguistic labels.
    * *File:* `src/cognitive_core.py`

3.  **Meristic Apollo (The Survival Instinct):**
    * *Function:* Lateral Engineering & Evolution.
    * *Mechanism:* When a VETO occurs, it spawns 50 mutant strategies (Dampening, Tolerance Shift, Signal Bypass). It simulates them against physics and applies the survivor.
    * *File:* `src/meristic_core.py`

4.  **The Cortex (Memory):**
    * *Function:* Holographic Persistence.
    * *Mechanism:* Stores learned patterns and evolutionary adaptations in a persistent JSON cortex.
    * *File:* `src/digital_genome_core.py`

## 🚀 Execution Guide

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.9+
* `numpy`, `pandas` (Standard Data Science Stack)

### Running the Universal Test
The framework includes a Universal Loader that adapts to NASA Turbofan Data (`.txt`) and Financial Process Logs (`.xes`).

```bash
# Run the Cognitive Loop
python src/debug_framework.py
```

## Expected Behavior (The Voyager Effect)
1.  **Ingestion:** The system loads raw data streams.
1.  **Crisis:** It identifies a vector that breaches physical safety limits (INTERLOCK).
1.  **Evolution:** The log shows 🧬 MERISTIC: Brainstorming solutions....
1.  **Adaptation:** The system finds a workaround (e.g., ✨ Solution Found via Adapted Tolerance).
1.  **Survival:** The final verdict changes from VETO to ACCEPTED.

## 🔬 Scientific Validation
Test Run: NASA C-MAPSS FD001 + FD003

    * *Vectors Processed:* 750
    * *Critical Failures Detected:* 12
    * *Autonomous Adaptations:* 12
    * *Mission Failures (Vetos):* 0

The system successfully evolved "Tolerance Shift" strategies to maintain operation during engine degradation phases, effectively extending the asset's useful life autonomously.
