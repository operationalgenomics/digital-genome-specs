# Architecture Summary
### High-Level Structural Overview of the Digital Genome Cognitive Ecosystem

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

The **Architecture Summary** provides a concise, high-level view of the entire Digital Genome Ecosystem.  
It explains how all major subsystems fit together, why each exists, and how information, intent, knowledge, decisions, actions, and feedback flow across the architecture.

Where detailed `.md` files describe *each* subsystem, this document describes *the system as a whole*.

It is intended for:
- architects,
- executives,
- researchers,
- onboarding teams,
- integrators,
- and anyone seeking a unified mental model before diving into deep specifications.

---

## 2. The Four-Layer Architecture

The Digital Genome Ecosystem is organized into four canonical layers:

1. **UNL Layer** — Understanding human expression  
2. **Cognitive Core Layer** — Reasoning, simulation, and decision-making  
3. **Digital Genome Layer** — Structured, evolvable knowledge and praxeology  
4. **System Layer** — Execution, monitoring, governance, safety, deployment

These layers form a closed cognitive loop enabling safe, adaptive behavior.

## 3. High-Level System Diagram (Conceptual)

```ts
Human → UNL → Cognitive Core → Digital Genome → Execution → Monitoring → Feedback → Governance ↺
```

This loop ensures:
- human intent is understood,
- decisions are correct and safe,
- actions are executed reliably,
- outcomes are evaluated,
- knowledge evolves,
- governance remains in control.

## 4. Subsystem Summaries

### 4.1 Universal Neutral Language (UNL)
UNL is the system’s input and output layer for human communication.

It provides:
- semantic parsing,
- contextual interpretation,
- multimodal fusion,
- intent disambiguation,
- codification into praxeological structure,
- translation back into human language.

UNL ensures **precision, neutrality, and explainability**.

---

### 4.2 Cognitive Core
The Cognitive Core performs structured, explainable reasoning.

Its components include:
- the **Inference Engine** (decision-making),
- the **Simulation Engine** (prediction and verification),
- the **Context Evaluator**,
- the **Oracle Synthesizer** (action forecasting),
- the **Merism Evolution Engine** (adaptive evolution).

The Cognitive Core selects **genes** and generates **codon sequences** representing actionable plans.

---

### 4.3 Digital Genome
The Digital Genome encodes:
- all knowledge,
- all behavioral logic,
- all safe and approved actions.

It consists of modular units:
- **genes** (strategies),
- **codons** (atomic praxeological actions),
- **variants**,
- **anti-genes**,
- **fitness evolution mechanisms**.

It is the stable, auditable, evolvable “DNA” of cognition.

---

### 4.4 System Layer
The System Layer translates cognition into real-world action.

It includes:
- **Execution Model** (orchestration and actuation),
- **Monitoring Model** (telemetry, anomaly detection),
- **Feedback Model** (learning from outcomes),
- **Governance Model** (policies, authority, safety oversight),
- **Safety Invariants, Failure Modes, Reliability Model**, and
- **Deployment Model** (runtime and distribution).

This layer ensures the entire ecosystem remains:
- safe,
- governed,
- reliable,
- traceable,
- deployable.

## 5. Cross-Layer Interactions

### 5.1 UNL ↔ Cognitive Core
UNL delivers contextualized intent; Cognitive Core returns explanations.

### 5.2 Cognitive Core ↔ Digital Genome
The Genome acts as the repository of all strategies; the Core selects and evolves them.

### 5.3 Cognitive Core ↔ System Layer
Execution plans are generated by cognition and enforced by governance.

### 5.4 Monitoring ↔ Feedback
Telemetry is converted into performance and safety insights.

### 5.5 Governance ↔ All Layers
Governance validates every critical decision and every cognitive output.

---

## 6. End-to-End Behavior Summary

An illustrative flow:

1. Human expresses intent.
2. UNL interprets it unambiguously.
3. Cognitive Core reasons, simulates, and selects a gene.
4. Digital Genome provides codons and operational knowledge.
5. System executes actions in the real world.
6. Monitoring observes behavior and detects problems.
7. Feedback adjusts cognition and gene fitness.
8. Governance ensures compliance and safety at every step.

This creates a **self-correcting, evolvable, governed intelligence loop**.

---

## 7. Architectural Principles

### 7.1 Modularity
Each subsystem evolves independently.

### 7.2 Determinism
Given the same inputs and context, the system must behave identically.

### 7.3 Explainability
Every decision includes a trace and rationale.

### 7.4 Safety Dominance
Safety > Governance > Performance > Efficiency.

### 7.5 Evolution Within Bounds
The system learns but cannot violate safety or governance.

## 8. Summary

This Architecture Summary outlines how the Digital Genome Ecosystem is structured into layered modules that collectively form a governed, safe, adaptive, explainable cognitive system.

Each layer fulfills a distinct purpose, but all layers are connected through explicit integration contracts to create a unified, resilient whole.
